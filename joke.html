    This was taken from the Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy. Here's the quote:
    <br>
    "Good morning," said Deep Thought at last.
    <br>
    "Er... Good morning, O Deep Thought," said Loonquawl nervously, "do you have... er, that is..."
    <br>
    "An answer for you?" interrupted Deep Thought majestically. "Yes. I have."
    <br>
    The two men shivered with expectancy. Their waiting had not been in vain.
    <br>
    "There really is one?" breathed Phouchg.
    <br>
    "There really is one," confirmed Deep Thought.
    <br>
    "To Everything? To the great Question of Life, the Universe and Everything?"
    <br>
    "Yes."
    <br>
    Both of the men had been trained for this moment, their lives had been a preparation for it, they had been selected at birth as those who would witness the answer, but even so they found themselves gasping and squirming like excited children.
    <br>
    "And you're ready to give it to us?" urged Loonquawl.
    <br>
    "I am."
    <br>
    "Now?"
    <br>
    "Now," said Deep Thought.
    <br>
    They both licked their dry lips.
    <br>
    "Though I don't think," added Deep Thought, "that you're going to like it."
    <br>
    "Doesn't matter!" said Phouchg. "We must know it! Now!"
    <br>
    "Now?" inquired Deep Thought.
    <br>
    "Yes! Now..."
    <br>
    "Alright," said the computer and settled into silence again. The two men fidgeted. The tension was unbearable.
    <br>
    "You're really not going to like it," observed Deep Thought.
    <br>
    "Tell us!"
    <br>
    "Alright," said Deep Thought. "The Answer to the Great Question..."
    <br>
    "Yes...!"
    <br>
    "Of Life, the Universe and Everything..." said Deep Thought.
    <br>
    "Yes...!"
    <br>
    "Is..." said Deep Thought, and paused.
    <br>
    "Yes...!"
    <br>
    "Is..."
    <br>
    "Yes...!!!...?"
    <br>
    "Forty-two," said Deep Thought, with infinite majesty and calm.
